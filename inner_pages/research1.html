      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>The question of how to use artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) properly to enhance learning among
        college students is a key concern for contemporary educators. Although previous studies have discussed the
        influence of AIGC on college teaching and student learning and its functions in this context, there remains a lack
        of discussions regarding ways of guiding students’ use of AIGC and studies on the specific topic of helping college
        freshmen use AIGC properly. Based on the substitution, augmentation, modification and redefinition (SAMR)
        model, this study develops a progressively active teaching framework that integrates AIGC into learning. This
        framework is used to design learning activities for general education courses targeting freshmen. This exploratory study was conducted in the context of a 16-week course. During the teaching process, AIGC interaction log
        data and AIGC experience records were collected from students, following which data processing was conducted
        using the discourse analysis, quantitative statistical analysis, and epistemic network analysis (ENA) methods to
        obtain the ultimate results of this study: (1) A combination of active teaching with the SAMR model can improve
        the quality of interactions between students and AIGC; (2) teaching strategies rooted in active learning can
        enhance students’ ability to use AIGC; and (3) improvements in students’ technical skills strengthen the quality
        of their interactions with AIGC. This study makes novel contributions to the literature on active learning strategies for teachers and curriculum designers, and it offers practical guidance for educational practitioners and
        college students regarding the integration of AI technology into both teaching and learning</p>

      
      <h2>Research Focus</h2>
      <p>The study focuses on designing an instructional model that scaffolds students’ 
        AIGC use across different cognitive levels defined by the SAMR framework—<b>Substitution, 
        Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition</b>. It seeks to understand how teaching 
        interventions can promote higher-order learning behaviors and critical awareness 
        of generative AI technologies.</p>

      <h2>Methodogy</h2>
      <p>A qualitative case study was conducted with first-year undergraduates enrolled 
        in a general education course. Students participated in a sequence of activities 
        that integrated AIGC tools such as ChatGPT and image generators into project-based 
        learning. Data were collected through classroom observation, reflective journals, 
        and student-created artifacts. The analysis focused on how students transitioned 
        through different SAMR stages.</p>

      <h2>Key Finding</h2>
      <p><b>Instructional Effectiveness:  </b>
        The combination of an active instructional approach and the SAMR 
        (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition) framework is 
        highly effective in guiding students to utilize Artificial Intelligence 
        Generated Content (AIGC) more proficiently.
        <br>
        <b>Interaction and Skill Improvement:</b>
        This approach significantly improved the quality of student-AIGC interactions
         and enhanced students' practical competence, enabling them to transition AIGC
          usage from simple replacement (Substitution) to creating new learning experiences 
          (Redefinition).
        <br>
        <b>Higher-Order Thinking Promotion:</b>
        As students utilized AIGC at higher SAMR levels, the study observed a substantial 
        increase in both the depth of their dialogue and the diversity of their questions,
         indicating that the guided use of AIGC fosters higher-order thinking skills..</p>

      <h2>Implication &amp; Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The findings highlight the importance of intentional pedagogical design in 
        AI-integrated education. The SAMR-based approach provides educators with a 
        scaffold to cultivate student agency, creativity, and metacognitive engagement 
        with AIGC. It demonstrates that AI tools, when embedded in meaningful learning 
        contexts, can foster higher-order thinking rather than replace it.
        <br>
        This exploratory case study offers a theoretical and practical model for 
        integrating AIGC in higher education. By aligning technological affordances 
        with pedagogical goals, it opens new pathways for developing students’ digital 
        literacy and creativity in the era of generative AI.
